This app will make studying easier
and more convenient by saving time. If a study room has the green icon, it is
available for use. If it has the red icon, it is occupied.\n\
\n\
Change the room status by tapping on the room or its name.
Be sure to change the status to available when you are done using the room and
change it to occupied when you are using it to notify other people.
